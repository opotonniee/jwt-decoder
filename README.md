# jwt-decoder

This very simple JWT decoder takes a JWT as input, parses it, and displays it in a formatted JSON format. I decodes dates for better readibility.

Although you can [use it on github](https://opotonniee.github.io/jwt-decoder/), it is not recommended: JWT are secrets that you should not paste on public sites. Instead it is recommended to clone this repository, and open the decoder directly from your disk, using the "file:" URL:

`file:///<path to clone repo>/index.html`

The code is kept minimum so that you can easily review it and check the JWT is not send anywhere.
